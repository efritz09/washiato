### Ideas for libraries
Since Adriano says we need to use 2 more libraries, here's a short list of some that I think we could use:

[Leak Canary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary): Detects memory leaks and stops them.

[Calligraphy](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy): Custom fonts.

Otherwise, check out [this](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries) for more libraries. There's a huge list that's split up into categories at the bottom.
