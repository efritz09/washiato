### Ideas for libraries
Since Adriano says we need to use 2 more libraries, here's a short list of some that I think we could use:

[Leak Canary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary): Detects memory leaks and stops them.

[Calligraphy](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy): Custom fonts.

Otherwise, check out [this](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries) for more libraries. There's a huge list that's split up into categories at the bottom.

### 05/06/2016- Arya
This is a basic barebones app template copied off of my smart bike code. Develop further! What it does:
-Compiles and runs (LOL)
-Registers a user with Firebase
-Allows you to login via Firebase
-Shows a silly laundry meme when you login. I'll play with it more to make it better, but this is what I currently have.
###NOTE: Not sure how Android Studio projects work with git (i.e. I don't know if you can see/open all files correctly. Let me know if you can't?).
