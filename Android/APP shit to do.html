	New shit to do?
		Maybe remove 'sign up' button, but if they enter a username they have the option to register, otherwise they continue as a unregistered
		Cluster screen has icons that change with the status?
			sleeping machine for open, filled for in use, something else for waiting to be removed
		Login with google?
		Settings screen?


NEW FORMAT:
login -> control
	control contains your last known cluster status with a dropdown menu for logout, nfc, other shit like that. it has a find clusters near me button which opens a maps application
